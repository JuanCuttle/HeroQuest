1) Status: Agi_up/down implemented.
2) Status: Rock_skin implemented.

Can be troublesome with Creature objects (change not made through ID)
3) Status: Cursed implemented (His turn is skipped. And, if he was Cursed, returns to Neutral)
4) Status: Courage implemented (The target gains 2 attack dice for his next attack, and returns to neutral)

5) Fire of Wrath and Ball of Flame implemented

6) Sleep implemented (COMPLEX)

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Adequately test all status!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

7) Addded instructions

8) Sleep, Agi_up, Agi_down, Rock_skin, Cursed working

9) Creatures can attack themselves with tailored message for those cases

10) Clearer error messages

11) Big GUI optimizations (only updates what is necessary) FINALLY

12) Beautiful character selection screen implemented

13) Next steps: Fix issue: verificaSeJogadorDaVez NullPointer Exception when using a player when it isn't their turn
				Finish implementing Status.COURAGE
				
14) Spear trap working, FallingRock trap blocks path (transforms to Rubble) and side choice works.

15) Known problem: infinite loop after hero died (and goblin dead (at trap?))
	When all monsters are dead and the player kills themselves, infinite loop at tratarFinalizarJogada, line ~1000.
	(maybe) SOLUTION:  counter at loop, exits loop if all are dead.
	
16) Known problem: GUI refresh doesn't update creature when far from next player
	SOLUTION: refreshes GUI before ending turn
	
17) Next steps: 13) and Pit traps

18) Pit traps working!!!! ALL TRAPS WORKING!!!

19) Adjusted treasure searching message (only appears once), exported jar music now works, Courage implemented and visible pit is now disarmed

20) Squashed Courage status removal bug, attempt of fixing verificaSeJogadorDaVez() NullPointerException (finished 13)), 
	added error message for trying to attack when not the players' turn, fixed error message for Zargon checking gold, 
	fixed bound checking in search for treasure and traps
	
21) Need to fix verificaSeJogadorDaVez() and player queue (GUI)
